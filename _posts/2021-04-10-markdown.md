## This is a trial file for markdown

### This is first paragraph with smaller font size

This is a normal paragraph.

Another paragraph

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> -Captain Janeway

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
     }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```python
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```


Some basic Git commands are:
```python
git status
git add
git commit
```

~~this~~

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
